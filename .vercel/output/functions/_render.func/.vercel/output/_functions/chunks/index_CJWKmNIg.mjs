I sleep a lot, 7-8 hours a day— sleeping works like preparation to me. If Im late to bed I’ll wake up late and start my day.\n\n4. I read a page or two of a book— immediately after waking up, it helps me prepare focus.\n\n5. I take a cold shower every morning— that’s where I win 20% of the day.\n\n6. I’m very conscious about my clothes, if my tailor makes a tiny mistake— I feel uncomfortable with that pair, I win the rest 30% when I put on my fresh shocks, when I fold my pant, when I wear my black analog watch, when I put on my glasses and fix it with my finger ( I use two pair of glasses, if you see me im wearing the black one—  Im in a mood to get shit done that day)\n\n7. I will always keep three hours focus time blocked on my calendar to do the work that I was preparing since last night, when I was taking a walk or drawing something on my dairy or thinking while taking shower — starts after 1.5 hours of waking up and that’s when I take caffeine, a tall iced americano ( if you see me drinking citrus or lemon cold brew— Im having a good time)  and mostly I spend my focus time sitting in a cafe.\n\n8. I avoid foods in the morning, a fruit bowl or eggs— that’s my breakfast before taking caffeine. I mostly eat veggies in week days, like  feeding the purpose only.\n\n9. Till 2 PM is only me, no phone, no meetings— if my phone rings that’s an important call or notification.\n\n10. I prefer actions more over motions and it’s play to me because im always productive when Im doing what I love to do and I don’t do what I don’t love to do and doing more I love—  makes me more productive and keeps me on track, If Im not focused or burnt out— to fix it, I will do something I love which is not a part my work life.\n\n11. My digital consumption is always optimized as per my persuasion. I consume mostly through reading but not excessive, books, newsletters, podcasts and my favorite— people.\n\n12. I avoid meta products, yes even WhatsApp and like to hang out with people who inspires me or I inspire them.\n13. My average screen time on phone is 1 hr 30 minutes a day during week days where— 30 minutes on X, 30 minutes on Mail or on some safari reading tab and 30 minutes gets used in miscellaneous which doesn’t involve any consumption or long conversation.\n\n14. I prefer in person communication and email as best medium to communicate, I love writing emails or receiving emails, some of my closest friends were strangers I decided to message on a whim. — Email is the best way to reach me or get something done by me.\n\n15. I do distributed living — meaning I don’t buy things which I can’t carry. I stay in hostels, hacker houses, and airbnbs and sometimes with family/ friends when I don’t work.\n16. My pencil and unruled dairy are the most productive tools for me, apart from that I use march, Raycast, Superhuman, [brain.fm](http://brain.fm/).\n\n— the most relatable productivity post on productive written — I found is this: https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity\n";
