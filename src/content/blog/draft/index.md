<span class="text-525252">to-dos in my system aren’t simple tasks like “water the plants” or “write a doc.” they take diverse forms: an article a friend shared, a twitter bookmark saved for later, a github issue I was assigned, a pull request i need to review, a linear ticket, or even a slack message. these "objects" are scattered across different tools and places.

here’s what my current stack and workflow looks like:
- email: I treat my inbox as a primary todo list, I constantly email myself in the future for ideas or todos that I want to work on.
- calendar: I set recurring focus time on the on calendar and try to log as much as  objects i can.
- late-night thoughts : stored in apple notes.
- work-related items: linear tickets and pull requests manually tracked across tools and added to my action plan in calendar or in raycast notes.
- content consumption: twitter bookmarks, articles are mostly saved in safari's reading list.



see whats happening here, I'm putting all the objects in different silos and as a result here are few examples of  what happens unless I've taken a oath to be super productive:
- the safari items are always cluttered unless occasionally put them in my calendar.
- i never clear the notion template where I saved a lot of stuff through browser.
- every silo needs my attention in order to make my brain visualise what needs to be done or to actually put something in my daily action plan.

now if you combine all the objects that are being added daily basis to all these tools actually makes a second brain of me:
- time: the calendar has information where my time is going
- todos: the email inbox has all the information what'm working on.
- notes: has all the information about my ideas and things that Im brainstorming and want to execute.
- reading list: has all the info what Im consuming.


why the calendar is so dump that it can content only meetings ?

what if I could use my calendar as my second brain ? what if it can store all the objects and constantly give me insights where I'm wasting my time ? suggest what I should focus on today tomorrow this week ? if am aligned with my goals and execution plan ? if I need more sleep based on my current work and schedule?

a multi- layered calendar:

think like a canvas that has views that stays together or layers ( calling them blocks):
a block that contents filtered /specific set of objects with a view, here is what I would imagine my today would like:

- A markdown editor ( a blank space where I can take notes of the day, can be a short journal too)
- A list view of all the meetings im having.
- A list of all the action items that i want to get done.
- and extended feed to the action items: activities that is being taken placed on that day.( activities can be a note i wrote or article that I saved or an a play, or a blocked time for badminton.. e.t.c)
- optional: a feed of all the recommended times ( can be comment made by my co-worker in a pull request and needs my attention or an article shared by a friend) 

Now each object can have a full and expanded view which is customisable and its just two key stroke away to go to an object.

a triage Inbox that is connected to all my tools that I use so that I don't have to manually pick things from the places to put it on my calendar more like a triage box I can triage all the incoming objects.
all objects: a list view of all the object and I can filter the list by types and source.


every date on the calendar is an array which has views or layer and that content specific set of objects.


now here is the cherry part: 
the calendar can be intelligent or agentic enough since we have now the power of LLMs:
- it sends a weekly summary of where my time went or any specific summary that I want.
- it remembers things about me my action items and sends me actionable insights that I need and right on time.
- or I cant talk to it and get insights such as  what's my procrastination score ? am I spending more time on meetings ? can you block time with elon to travel mars or email him that im using march and you he should too ? please write on my voice huh ? of course you know my style cause the whole thing I just wrote is an object of an array: friday 20 dec type : note

p.s the above is my raw notes on an essay written by Julian Lehr: 
Multi-layered calendars: Traveling through time in three dimensions — which i found the most relatable and further gave me clear pictures in my head how to build march. </span>
